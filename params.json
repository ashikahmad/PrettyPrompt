{"name":"Prettyprompt","tagline":"A new look for your bash prompt inspired by vim plugin vim-powerline.","body":"# PrettyPrompt\r\n*Clean & stylish prompt for bash that will change your feel about using bash ever after.* \r\n\r\n![Screen Shot](https://github.com/ashikahmad/PrettyPrompt/wiki/screen_shot.png)\r\n\r\n## Where did it come from?\r\nBasically this idea of [PrettyPrompt] is brought to light based on the idea of vim's statusbar plugin [powerline] or [vim-powerline] (and later from [vim-airline]). Later I've *stolen* some code from another vim plugin [promptline] which does somewhat same thing in a different way.\r\n\r\nIt could be a question then why [PrettyPrompt] where there is already [promptline]. The answer is, the dependency to a vim plugin for creting even a simple prompt with style and how I can update the prompt with promptline looks a bit complex to me. And as I already came to a solution, I wanted to merge the **best of both**. But to be honest, promptline is awesome!\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n*  Easy configurable sections (and sub-sections), you'll see only what you want to (username > pretty-path > [git-branch & git-status] is set to show by default).\r\n*  Show git branch with unstaged change indication by color (*green* for clean and *red* for changed by default).\r\n*  Design as you wish: \r\n    *  colors (background and foreground of sections)\r\n    *  charecters (section separator, sub-section seperator, git branch, ..)\r\n    *  path format\r\n    *  ... add more!\r\n*  Can work any with regular font/unicode symbles, but look awesome with powerline symbols. One powerline font patch (Menlo) is added with this repo.\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\n* Clone this repo your home dir: <br/>\r\n   `git clone git@github.com:ashikahmad/PrettyPrompt.git ~/.bash_extra`\r\n* Add this line to your .bash_profile/.bashrc:<br/>\r\n   `[ -f ~/.bash_extra/pretty_prompt.sh ] && source ~/.bash_extra/pretty_prompt.sh`\r\n* Install patched font (the one provided may be sufficient). See more in section below if needed.\r\n* Re-open your terminal and see it's working!\r\n\r\n## Configurations\r\n\r\n.. todo ..\r\n\r\n## Using Powerline patched font\r\n\r\n.. todo ..\r\n\r\n\r\n[vim-airline]:   https://github.com/bling/vim-airline\r\n[vim-powerline]: https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-powerline\r\n[powerline]:     https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline\r\n[promptline]:    https://github.com/edkolev/promptline.vim\r\n[PrettyPrompt]:  https://github.com/ashikahmad/PrettyPrompt  ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
